                        <p> As an introduction to the <strong>trucking industry</strong>, there are more than 3.5 millions truckers in the United States and counting. Trucking provides a critical infrastructure for economic activity, so the trucking business continues to grow even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Trucks transport anything from foods, to packaged goods, to raw materials and more.</p>

                       <p> Trucks are organized in groups called fleets, and Verizon Connect utilizes Verizon's expansive network for a competitive edge and offers <strong>fleet management solutions</strong> such as geotracking, asset management, route planning, and more to assist Fleet Managers to better manage their fleet of trucks.</p>

                        <p>As an <strong>occupation</strong>, drivers can spend up to 11 hours a day just driving, and a single truck can drive up to 125,000 miles per year. However, being a trucker remains one of the most dangerous jobs in the U.S.. They have the highest number of occupational fatalities each year, by a wide margin with around 500,000 trucking accidents occurring each year in the United States alone. Out of the 500,000 accidents, almost 5,000 resulted in deaths.</p>
                        
                        <p>When a truck accident occurs, it involves not only the driver, but also all of the surrounding drivers on the road due to how large a truck is, and also the cargo that’s being transported which could be extremely valuable or flammable.</p>

                        <p> One of the top 5 reasons for truck accidents are distracted drivers. Often times, drivers will get bored driving for hours at a time and will reach for their phones to read or reply text messages, make phone calls or even visit their favorite social media sites. The high ramifications are reflected in their fines and insurance rates. Drivers who use hand-held communication devices while driving can be fined up to $2,750 and up to $11,000 for their employers according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, or the FMCSA.</p>

                        <p>In addition to trucker specific research, we also sent out consumer surveys to evaluate comfort with audio based interactions within a vehicle and concluded that many people were comfortable with phone-based interactions such as with siri or google assistant, however during emergencies, they would use a phone to call for help instead.</p>

                        <p><img src="/VC images/Tax Code 179.jpg" width="100%"/></p>
                        <p>A key insight we discovered during our research is Tax Code 179. Tax Code 179 was created as an incentive by the government to encourage businesses to buy equipment and invest in themselves. What it does is allows companies to deduct leases on trucks for tax purposes which can result in hundreds of thousands of dollars saved. <strong>In other words, companies can lease and keep leasing every couple of years to deduct the full purchase amount without ever spending it. That means having removable equipment becomes important to companies because they rotate out to new trucks every 4 years as the industry standard.</strong> What this meant for us was that our device must be removable for maintenance to be able to uninstall and install it into a new truck more efficiently.</p>
                        
                        <p><img src="/VC images/FMCSA and NHTSA.jpg" width="100%"/></p>
                        <p>In order to make a product that is most apt for the truck driver, the opportunity to create a competitive and market leading trucker-facing hardware component lies in the product’s ability to be utilized within the FMCSA and NHTSA’s regulations for driving: <strong>2 sec eye glances away from the road and 5 second hands off wheel</strong> to not fall under the safety regulations placed on mobile phones or tablets in the cab.</p>
                        
                        <p><img src="/VC images/communication is key.jpg" width="100%"/></p>
                        <p> Currently, products on the market do not adhere to the existing safety regulations, and this requires the driver to stop driving in order to communicate through their tablet or phone fully with their fleet manager</p>
                        
                        <p><img src="/VC images/privacy.jpg" width="100%"/></p>
                        <p> In the past year, technology such as driver facing dash cams allow fleet managers to record accountability, however long haul truck drivers greatly value their personal privacy and do not want to feel as though they are being observed all the time while they are on the road, therefore this device should take that under consideration in its final design. </p>

                    <div id="projectbodytext" class="col-sm-9">
                        <p>Also important to note for a device that will be utilized in a trucking environment, other than the extra regulations,  is the difference in the surroundings of the driver. A regular truck cab is on average 3 feet taller than the average car cab, meaning that reaching for devices within the cab is a little more difficult for the centrally placed driver. Also, truck cabs tend to be much louder when the truck is in operation than when a car is running. This could potentially make sound and noise detection within the truck cab more difficult based on the amount of background noise picked up by the device.</p>

                        <p>Even though there are major differences between the cab of a truck and the driver seat of a car there are not that many differences between the potential communications within them.The two current communication methods employed by truck drivers is either through a tablet with fleet management software or direct mobile phone. However, due to existing regulations neither of the existing methods can be used while the driver is driving. This can, in instances where quick and efficient communication is important, delay the driver and compromise their delivery schedule.</p>

                        <p> In order to test feasibility a “works-like” model of the interaction types was created. This prototype has a functional push button to activate mics and a directional gesture sensor that gives lighted feedback as to which direction was sensed. (left, yes, green) (right, no, red). </p>

                        <h3>Procedure</h3>
                        <p><img src="/VC images/procedure.jpg" width="100%"/></p>
                        <p>The test was completed asking the subject to begin driving in a simulation while wearing eye-tracking glasses. Once they had acclimated to driving, the subjects were asked to have a message that was sent to them read aloud by the device and to initiate and send a new message by voice command. Once the subject had completed the commands with the voice flow they were then asked to repeat the receiving and sending message commands but replacing the commands yes and no for their respective gestures. Once they had completed the tests they were asked to complete a set of questions about their experience. The eye-tracking glasses recorded their eye-glance behavior which was then analyzed to obtain the amount of time they spent looking away from the road and at the device while they were completing each voice flow.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Results</h3>
                        <p><img src="/VC images/results.jpg" width="100%"/></p>
                        <p>From testing 20 subjects, it was found that it required a shorter amount of time glancing away from ‘road’ with prototype than the mobile phone, an overall 66.43% decrease in eye glance behavior. It was also verified with 99% confidence that even at the top end of the range of our hands-off wheel data that it would not require the user to remove their hands off the vehicle at any one time. Most notably, the qualitative gesture feedback indictated that the sensor should be moved closer to user than the button within the final design.</p>  
                        
                        <h3>Further Validation: Gesture &amp; Feedback</h3>
                        <p>In order to validate the use of alternate colors and directionality of gestures user testing was completed using a gesture sensor and a strip of lights. It was found that having two different colored directional lights allowed the user to more obviously notice the difference between a right and left detected swipe in their peripheral point of view. Although there is red/green colorblindness, the placement of these lights on each respective side of the device would allow for enough visual differentiation.</p>
                            
                        <p>It was also determined that there needed to be a differentiation between when the device is speaking rather than when it is loading a response to a detected vocal command.</p>

                       <h3>Form Inspiration</h3>
                        <p><img src="/VC images/form inspiration.jpg" width="100%"/></p>
                        <p>As we refined our user interaction, we also refined the form of the device. In addition to optimizing the form for the user interaction through features such as an angled top surface for pressing the device to activate it, a brightly colored mesh for easy confirmation that the device is listening, and more, the form was heavily inspired by form factors found in automobiles and form silhouettes that evoke a sense of motion, firmly grounding the device’s placement within a vehicle and emphasizing it’s forward thinking design and interactions. </p>
                        
                        <h3>Form Iteration</h3>
                        <p><img src="/VC images/form developement.jpg" width="100%"/></p>
                        <p>Overall our final design ended up being a mix a few of these concepts. We took the angled surface and light bar from concept 1 for its optimal visibility to to user as this became a key interaction point between the device and the user, allowing the user to confirm which gesture was registered and if the device was processing their commands. This angled top surface also provided a more optimal angle for the user to press as compared to a flat surface. We took the backlit metal mesh from concept 2 to act as the mic covering to provide clear confirmation to the user that the device was listening, however we replaced the brushed metal with anodized metal in Verizon Connect’s red to better match the brand language. We took the overall form from concept 3 in its illuminated parting line, chamfered edges, and ability to hide and reveal the microphones when pressed. The chamfered edges allow for better light reflection, while the unique parting line creates a premium feel to match Verizon Connect’s placement within the market.</p>

                        <p><img src="/VC images/manufacturing.jpg" width="100%"/></p>
                        <p>Throughout our process we refinined our design for manufacturing and assembly. We considered factors such as draft and consistent wall thickness required for manufacturing processes like injection molding plastic and ways parts could be overmolded together to create muti-material parts that minimized the number of fasteners needed during assembly. Throughout the creation of the production ready CAD model, we had to consider trade-offs between increased manufacturing complexity to increased assembly complexity, finding ways to reduce both where possible. </p>
                        
                        <h3>Assembly</h3>
                        <p><img src="/VC images/assembly.jpg" width="100%"/></p>
                        <p>As we optimized our design for assembly, we conducted a design for assembly analysis on our components, sub assemblies, and full assembly to establish the time and cost for assembly of each. Taking this into consideration, we identified which parts could be assembled in parallel compared to which parts must be assembled in sequence. The upper and lower assemblies can be put together in parallel, greatly reducing the overall time for assembly of the device, which comes in at 2 minutes and 17 seconds. By minimizing the time and complexity required for assembly, we were able to keep the assembly cost down to $1.29 per unit.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Cost</h3>
                        <p><img src="/VC images/bom.jpg" width="100%"/></p>
                        <p>In addition to assembly cost, we also estimated part costs of both manufactured parts and purchased components. In total, we estimate the device will cost $48 to manufacture and assemble. Around $10 of that comes from manufactured parts, most of which are injection molded plastic, while around $35 comes from purchased components, most expensive of which are the IR sensors that allow for gesture controls at a total of $4 and the top rim RGB LEDs that indicate what gesture the device has registered or the mode the device is in to the user along with their controllers located on the PCB, all of which comes in at around $15 total. Because the LEDs are RGB, the device can use both red and green light in addition to the location of light to indicate to the user if a “yes” or “no” gesture has been registered from their peripheral vision, meaning they don’t have to take their eyes off the road to confirm their gesture was accurately registered. Though these components are expensive, their benefit to the user experience with the device justifies their cost. </p>
